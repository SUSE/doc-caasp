== Branches

[IMPORTANT]
Changes to already released versions of the documentation must be merged to a `maintenance/CaaSX` branch from the maintainer.

We maintain three versions of the product at this point:

* master (ongoing 4.5.x work)
* maintenance/CaaS4.5 (4.5.x released version and incremental updates)
* maintenance/CaaS4 (4.2.x released version and incremental updates)

== Files and Directory Structure

* `DC-caasp-*`: Configuration files for the exported guides.
* `adoc/`: Contains all the pages that make up the content.
* `adoc/book_*`: Meta files collating pages into a guide document.
* `adoc/attributes.adoc` - Contains all version numbers of the product and its components.
Also contains the `release_type` flag that determines if the branch contains an `public` or (SUSE) `internal` release.
* `adoc/entities.adoc` - Contains text substitutions for often used component names and strings.
* `adoc/common_*`: Include files with common information like legal disclaimers and licenses.
* `adoc/admin-*`: Pages belonging to the Admin guide.

* `adoc/architecture-*`: Pages belonging to the Architecture guide.
* `adoc/quick-*`: Pages belonging to the Quickstart guide.

== Editing AsciiDoc

To contribute to the documentation you will use AsciiDoc syntax.

* You can learn about AsciiDoc syntax at link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[]
** A much more detailed manual can be found link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[here]
* For simple preview use the browser extensions for
** https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[Chrome]
** https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Firefox]
** Make sure you set the "security" setting in the Extension Preferences to `server`

* SUSE documents are generally built with DAPS (package `daps`) and the
  SUSE XSL Stylesheets (package `suse-xsl-stylesheets`). It's available as a
  SUSE rpm package from the the SUSE repository http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Documentation:/Tools/[Documentation:Tools] or
  directly from https://github.com/openSUSE/suse-xsl/[Github].
* If you are running a (recent) version of openSUSE, you can install our documentation toolchain with the following command:
`sudo /sbin/OneClickInstallUI https://gitlab.nue.suse.com/susedoc/doc-ymp/raw/master/Documentation.ymp`
* If you don't want to download the entire documentation toolchain, you can also build documentation using DAPS inside a Docker container with https://github.com/openSUSE/daps2docker[daps2docker]:
** Clone the daps2docker repository.
** Change directory to the folder which contains your documentation source files (`doc-caasp`).
** Execute the `daps2docker.sh` file, for example by running `../daps2docker/daps2docker.sh .`.
** Follow the commandline instructions for further building options.
* Basic daps usage:
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> validate`: Make sure what you have written is
    well-formed XML and valid DocBook 5
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> pdf`: Build a PDF document
** `$ daps -d DC-<YOUR_BOOK> html`: Build multi-page HTML document
