  <title>Installing an &Admin_Node; using &ay;</title>

  <para/>

  <para>
   To assist with automating the installation of &productname; clusters as much
   as possible, it is possible to automatically install the &admin_node; with
   &ay;, similarly to the process used for &worker_node;s.
  </para>
  <para>
   Be aware, though, that this requires considerable customisation of the
   <literal>autoyast.xml</literal> file.
  </para>
  <para>
   Here is a sample file to create an &admin_node;.
  </para>
  <screen>
<xi:include href="autoyast_example_adminnode.xml" parse="text"/>
  </screen>

  <para/>

  <para>
   Copy the above and paste it into a file named <literal>autoyast.xml</literal>,
   then edit it as appropriate for your configuration. After you have prepared
   the file, you will need to put it on a Web server that is accessible to the
   &productname; cluster.
  </para>
  <para>
   After this, install the admin node by following the same procedure as for a
   &worker_node; in <xref linkend="sec.deploy.nodes.worker_install.manual.autoyast"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more information about using and customizing &ay;, refer to

  <title>Installing &cilium;</title>

  <warning>
   <title>Tech Preview</title>
   <para>
    Please note &cilium; is currently only a tech preview. It will work but
    is not officially supported.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <para>
   &kube; allows to choose one of many available Network Plugins, which usually
   come in form of &cni; plugins.
  </para>
  <para>
   &kube; provides a specification called &net_pols; which define how groups of
   pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network
   endpoints. &net_pols; are clustered firewall rules defined with &kube;
   concepts. But &kube; does not provide &net_pols; implementation on its own.
  </para>
  <para>
   &cni; plugins are supposed to implement &net_pols; for &kube;. By default,
   &productname; ships &flannel; as a default &cni; plugin. However, &flannel;
   does not provide &net_pols; support.
  </para>
  <para>
   &productname; provides another &cni; plugin as a tech preview feature -
   &cilium; - which supports &net_pols;.
  </para>
  <para>
   The main characteristic of &cilium; is using &ebpf;
   (<link xlink:href="https://opensource.com/article/17/9/intro-ebpf">extended Berkeley Packet Filter</link>)
   as a mechanism for filtering incoming and outgoing packets in containers.
   &ebpf; is a bytecode interpreter inside Linux kernel which allows to write
   programs to analyze, filter network packets and to monitor system function
   calls. &cilium; translates &net_pols; into &ebpf; programs which are loaded
   into the kernel.
  </para>
  <para>
   This section shows how to set up &cilium; on &productname; and check whether
   it is working.

    The current implementation of &cilium; deployment in &productname; does not
    allow yet to use L7 network policies (only L3 and L4).
    <!-- The support of L7
    policies will be enabled when &envoy; will be packaged and shipped in
    &opensuse; and &sle;. &envoy; will also bring a possibility of creating a
