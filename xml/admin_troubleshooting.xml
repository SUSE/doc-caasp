   In case of problems, a detailed system report can be created with
   the <command>supportconfig</command> command line tool. It will
   collect information about the system such as: current kernel
   version, hardware, installed packages, partition setup, and much
   more. The result is a TAR archive of files. After opening a Service
   Request (SR), you can upload the TAR archive to Global Technical
   Support. It will help to locate the issue you reported and to assist
   you in solving the problem. For details, see <link xlink:href=
