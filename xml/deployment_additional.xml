 <para>
  Once your cluster is ready, you may want to deploy additional software
  that is not installed on &productname; by default. This chapter provides
  instructions on how to install and configure various tools and services.
 </para>

<sect1 xml:id="installing.helm">
  <title>Deploying &helm; and &tiller;</title>
<para>
&helm; charts provide a standard way to deploy &kube; applications. While
&tiller; (the &helm;'s server-side component) is not installed on &productname;
by default, it can be installed by enabling the appropriate option in the Velum graphical
interface. When the <guimenu>Install &tiller;</guimenu> option is enabled,
&tiller; is installed as a container on a &productname; 2 cluster from the
installation media.
</para>

<para>
Once &tiller; is installed on &productname; 2 cluster, the &helm;
client can be used to interact with &tiller; and the cluster. To initialize the
&helm; client (which automatically discovers &tiller; in the cluster), run the
<command>helm init --client-only</command> command. You
can then use the &helm; client as described in the official documentation at <link
xlink:href="https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#using-helm" />.
</para>

  <note>
   <title>&helm; and &tiller; are Optional</title>
    <para>
      Both &helm; and &tiller; are optional, unless you plan to run a
      &suse; Cloud Application Platform.
    </para>
  </note>

<para>
&tiller; that ships with &productname; is supported by &suse;. While &suse;
does not provide support for third-party &helm; charts, you can easily use them
if necessary.

  <title>Installing &kube; Dashboard</title>

  <important>
   <title>Technology Preview</title>
   <para>
    Even though you can install and use the &kube; dashboard, &productname;
    currently fully supports only &dashboard;.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   To install the &kube; dashboard, perform the following steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>

   <step>
    <para>
     Connect to the &admin_node; using SSH.

<screen>kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.6.3/src/deploy/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     After the previous command finishes, run the following to expose the
     proxy:

    Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     In your browser open <emphasis>http://127.0.0.1:8001/ui</emphasis>. The
     &kube; dashboard is running there.
