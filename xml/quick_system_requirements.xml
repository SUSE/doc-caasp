  <title>&productname; System Requirements</title>

 <para>
  Before you begin the installation, please make sure your system meets all the
  requirements listed below.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.caasp.quickstart.clusreqs">
  <title>Cluster Size Requirements</title>

  <para>
   &productname; is a dedicated cluster operating system and only functions in a
   multi-node configuration. It requires a connected group of four or more
   physical or virtual machines. 
  </para>
  <para>
   Four nodes is the minimum supported cluster size: a single &admin_node;, one 
   &master_node;, and two &worker_node;s.
  </para>
  <note>
   <title>Test and Proof-of-Concept Clusters</title>
   <para>
    It is possible to provision a three-node cluster with only a single
    &worker_node;, but this is not a supported configuration for deployment.
   </para>
  </note>
  <para>
   For improved performance, multiple &master_node;s are supported, but there
   must always be an odd number. For cluster reliability, in the event of using
   multiple master nodes, some form of DNS load-balancing should be used. 
  </para>
   <para>Any number of &worker_node;s may be added up to the maximum supported
    cluster size.
  </para>

    <para>
     Each node must have an AMD64/Intel* EM64T processor; quad-core processors
     are recommended. 32-bit processors are not supported.

     40 GB available disk space (or more depending on the count and size of the
     container images you intend to run).

     8 GB physical RAM per node.

  <note>
   <title>Swap Partitions</title>
   <para>
    A requirement of &kube; means that &productname; &productnumber; does
    not support swapping to disk. Due to a technical limitation in the
    installation program, the &admin_node; will have a small swap partition, but
    this is inactive and not used. Nodes installed using AutoYaST have no swap.
   </para>
   <para>
    Thus, if a node has insufficient physical RAM available, its operation may
    fail. RAM sizing is thus more important than for typical Linux operating 
    systems.
   </para>

     All nodes should to be on the same network. It is important that the nodes
     can communicate without interruptions.

    <para>
     A DHCP server to dynamically provide IP addresses and host names for the
     nodes in your cluster (unless you configure all nodes statically).
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     It is recommended to let the DHCP server provide not only the IP addresses
     but also the host names of the cluster nodes. 
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A DNS server to resolve host names. Please make sure you have reliable DNS
     resolution at all times, especially in combination with DHCP.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The &admin_node; and &kube; API server; must both have valid
     fully-qualified domain names (FQDN). If the cluster has a single &master_node;,
     then this is the &kube; API server.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Both these FQDNs are required during installation. They cannot  
     subsequently be added or changed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The &admin_node; must be visible from a separate machine on your
     organization's network, and accessible via a web browser, in order to
     complete the  installation.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     All nodes must be able to resolve the name of the &admin_node;. It is not
     required for &worker_node;s to have resolvable names, although this is not
     problematic and may aid troubleshooting. 
    </para>

    <para>
     For clusters with multiple &master_node;s:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       There must be an odd number of &master_node;s.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       All &master_node;s must be accessible via a single FQDN.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If the FQDN only points to a single &master_node; and it is removed,
       cluster functionality will degrade. For this reason, using
       load-balancing is recommended.

  <important>
   <title>Unique Host Names</title>
   <para>
    All nodes' host names must be unique. If two or more nodes have the same
    host name, bootstrap of the cluster will fail.
   </para>
  </important>
  
  <note>
   <title>Clusters without Fully-Qualified Domain Names</title>
   <para>
    For test purposes, IP addresses can be substituted for the FQDNs for the
    &admin_node; and &master_node;, but this is not supported for production 
    deployment.
