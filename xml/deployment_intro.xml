  container management solution designed to simplify the deployment, management,

  &productname; consists of an integrated software stack on top of &suse; &mos;.
  &suse; &mos; is a minimalist operating system based on &sle; 12 SP3, dedicated
  to hosting containers. &suse; &mos; OS inherits the benefits of &sle; in the
  form of a smaller, simpler, and more robust operating system, optimized for
  large, clustered deployments. It also features an atomic, transactional update
  mechanism, making the system more resilient against software-update-related
  problems.

  &suse; &productname; turns four or more dedicated machines into a complete, 
  managed &kube; cluster. Each node can host multiple pods of containers, and
