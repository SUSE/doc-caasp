   By default the <command>caasp-admin-setup</command> executable operates in

   During this process your &scc; credentials will be requested. Registration
   with &scc; can be skipped. If this step is skipped during setup the admin node
   and the cluster nodes will not receive any updates. While registration to
   &scc; can be performed after the initial setup with
   <literal>SUSEConnect</literal>, performing the registration during setup has
   the advantage that cluster nodes will automatically be registered with &scc;
   as well. If you prefer not to run the <literal>wizard</literal>, use
   <command>caasp-admin-setup --help</command> to obtain a list of the
   available command line arguments.

   Once the <literal>caasp-admin-setup</literal> process is complete all

   If you did not provide your own certificate, a certificate was generated for

   <command>caasp-admin-setup</command> was executed. You can compare this

    The general purpose of <command>caasp-admin-setup</command> is to collect

   </para>
   <para>
    When <command>caasp-admin-setup</command> is executed it determines which
    cluster node image to use according to the cloud framework. For this
    operation to succeed outgoing traffic on port <literal>443</literal> to the
    Internet must be permitted. The code will access the <literal>Public Cloud
    Information Tracker</literal> service operated by SUSE. This service
    provides information about all images ever released to the Public Cloud by
    SUSE. The latest available cluster node image for this version of
    &productname; will be used. This initial outreach and image filtering
    introduces a small startup delay before the command line options are
    processed or the wizard mode starts.

   <para>
    In order to use your own SSL certificate and key you must upload the files
    to the admin node into a location of your choice. This location is then
    provided to the setup code. For example, if your certificate is called
    <filename>my-velum.crt</filename> and you uploaded it to
    <filename>/tmp</filename> then the <command>caasp-admin-setup</command>
    code expects <filename>/tmp/my-velum.crt</filename> as the location for
    the SSL certificate. The same concept applies to the SSL key. The
    certificate and key will be placed in the appropriate locations on the
    admin node.

   <title>Registering with &scc;</title>
   <para>
    To register all cluster nodes with &scc;, provide your e-mail
    address and the registration code. The registration process
    requires access to the Internet on port 443. Alternatively you may
    use the <literal>--reg-email</literal> and
    <literal>--reg-code</literal> arguments. Registration with &scc; is
    optional. However, without registration the system will not receive
    any updates unless specifically setup to receive updates via a
    different route such as a private &smt; server. Registration after
    the initial setup also requires an explicit registration of each
    node in the cluster.

        <para>
         The overlay network settings have to be verified and adjusted so that
         they do not collide with any services / addresses in the infrastructure
         that potentially need to be reached from any node or
         service running within the &productname; cluster.

        <para>
         For example, an oracle database is running on <literal>172.16.4.5</literal>
         in the existing infrastructure and a pod in the cluster needs to
         contact that database. Then, the defaults be adjusted to provide a
         different overlay network. Another example would be an NFS server or
         a SES/Ceph cluster running anywhere in the network
         <literal>172.16.0.0/13</literal> and where persistent storage access
         of the CaaSP cluster should be hosted on.
