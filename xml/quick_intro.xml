 <para>
 &suse; &productname; is a Cloud-Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified
 &kube; distribution on top of &suse; &mos;.
 &suse; &mos; is a minimalist operating system based on &sle; 12 SP3, dedicated
 to hosting containers. &suse; &mos; OS inherits the benefits of &sle; in the
 form of a smaller, simpler, and more robust operating system, optimized for
 large, clustered deployments. It also features an atomic, transactional update
 mechanism, making the system more resilient against software-update-related
 problems.

 In addition, &productname; simplifies the platform operatorâ€™s experience, with
 everything you need to get up and running quickly, and to manage the
 environment effectively in production. It provides:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   A complete container execution environment, including a purpose-built
   container host operating system (&suse; &mos;), container runtime, and
   container image registries.
  </para>

 You can deploy &productname; onto physical servers or use it on virtual
 machines. After deployment, it is immediately ready to run and provides a
 highly-scalable cluster.
</para>
<para>
 While &productname; inherits benefits of &sle; and uses tools and
 technologies well-known to system administrators such as
 <literal>cloud-init</literal> and Salt, the main innovation (compared to
 &sls;) comes with <emphasis role="bold">transactional updates</emphasis>. A
 transactional update is an update that can be installed when the system is
 running without any down-time. A transactional update can be rolled back, so
 if the update fails or is not compatible with your infrastructure, you can
 restore the previous system state.
