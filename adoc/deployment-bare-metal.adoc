== Deployment on Bare Metal

=== Environment Description

[IMPORTANT]
====
These instructions currently do not describe how to set up a load balancer.
This will be added in future versions. You must provide your own load balancing
solution that directs access to the master nodes.
====

[NOTE]
====
The {ay} file found in `skuba` is a template. It has the base requirements.
This {ay} file should act as a guide and should be updated with your company's standards.
====

[NOTE]
====
To account for hardware/platform-specific setup criteria (legacy BIOS vs. (U)EFI, drive partitioning, networking, etc.),
you must adjust the {ay} file to your needs according to the requirements.

Refer to the official {ay} documentation for more information: link:https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html[{ay} Guide].
====

==== Hardware Prerequisites

Deployment with {ay} will require a minimum *disk size of 40 GB*.
10 GB out of that total space will be reserved for container images without any workloads,
for the root partition (30 GB) and the EFI system partition (200 MB).

=== {ay} Preparation

. On the management machine, get an example {ay} file from `/usr/share/caasp/autoyast/bare-metal/autoyast.xml`,
(which was installed earlier on as part of the management pattern (`sudo zypper in -t pattern SUSE-CaaSP-Management`).
. Copy the file to a suitable location to modify it. Name the file `autoyast.xml`.
. Modify the following places in the {ay} file (and any additional places as required by your specific configuration/environment):
.. `<ntp-client>`
+
Change the pre-filled value to your organization's NTP server. Provide multiple servers if possible by adding new `<ntp_server>` subentries.
.. `<username>sles</username>`
+
Insert your authorized key in the placeholder field.
.. `<users>`
+
You can add additional users by creating new blocks in the configuration containing their data.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the users are configured to not have a password like in the example, ensure the system's `sudoers` file is updated.
Without updating the sudoers file the user will only be able to perform basic operations that will prohibit many administrative tasks.

The default {ay} file provides examples for a disabled `root` user and a `sles` user with authorized key SSH access.

The password for root can be enabled by using the `passwd` command.
====
.. `<suse_register>`
+
Insert the email address and {productname} registration code in the placeholder fields. This activates {sle} 15 SP1.
.. `<addon>`
+
Insert the {productname} registration code in the placeholder field. This enables the {productname} extension module.
Update the {ay} file with your registration keys and your company's best practices and hardware configurations.
+
[NOTE]
====
Your {productname} registration key can be used to both activate {sle} 15 SP1 and enable the extension.
====

+
Refer to the official {ay} documentation for more information: link:https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html[{ay} Guide].
+
. Host the {ay} files on a Web server reachable inside the network your are installing the cluster in.

=== Provisioning the Cluster Nodes

Once the {ay} file is available in the network that the machines will be configured in, you can start deploying machines.

The default production scenario consists of 8 nodes:

* 2 load balancers
* 3 masters
* 3 workers

Depending on the type of load balancer you wish to use, you need to deploy at least 6 machines to serve as cluster nodes and provide 2 load balancers from the environment.

The load balancer must point at the machines that are assigned to be used as `master` nodes in the future cluster.

[TIP]
If you do not wish to use infrastructure load balancers, please deploy additional machines and refer to <<loadbalancer>>.

Install {sle} 15 SP1 from your preferred medium and follow the steps for link:https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#invoking_autoinst[Invoking the Auto-Installation Process]

Provide `autoyast=https://[webserver/path/to/autoyast.xml]` during the {sle} 15 SP1 installation.

==== {sls} Installation

[NOTE]
====
Use AutoYaST and make sure to use a staged frozen patchlevel via RMT/SUSE Manager to ensure a 100% reproducible setup.

====

Once the machines have been installed using the {ay} file, you are now ready to bootstrap your cluster:
