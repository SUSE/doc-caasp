== Deployment on Amazon AWS

.Preparation Required
[NOTE]
You must have completed <<deployment.preparations>> to proceed.

You will use {tf} to deploy the required master and worker cluster nodes (plus a load
balancer) and then use the `skuba` tool to bootstrap the {kube} cluster on
top of those.

. Download the AWS credentials
.. Log in to the AWS console.
.. Click on your username in the upper right hand corner to reveal the dropdown menu.
.. Click on My Security Credentials.
.. Click Create Access Key on the Security Credentials tab.
.. Note down the newly created _Access_ and _Secret_ keys.

=== Deploying the cluster nodes

. On the management machine, find the {tf} template files for AWS in
`/usr/share/caasp/terraform/aws` (which was installed as part of the management
pattern (`sudo zypper in -t pattern SUSE-CaaSP-Management`)).
Copy this folder to a location of your choice as the files need adjustment.
+
----
mkdir -p ~/caasp/deployment/
cp -r /usr/share/caasp/terraform/aws/ ~/caasp/deployment/
cd ~/caasp/deployment/aws/
----
. Once the files are copied, rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to
`terraform.tfvars`:
+
----
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
----
. Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and add modify the following variables:
+
include::deployment-terraform-example.adoc[tags=tf_aws]
+
[TIP]
====
You can set timezone in before deploying the nodes by modifying the files:

* `~/caasp/deployment/aws/cloud-init/cloud-init.yaml.tpl`
====
. Enter the registration code for your nodes in `~/caasp/deployment/aws/registration.auto.tfvars`:
+
Substitute `REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.
+
[source,json]
----
# SUSE CaaSP Product Registration Code
caasp_registry_code = "REGISTRATION_CODE"
----
+
This is required so all the deployed nodes can automatically register to {scc} and retrieve packages.
. Now you can deploy the nodes by running:
+
----
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----
+
Check the output for the actions to be taken. Type "yes" and confirm with Enter when ready.
Terraform will now provision all the machines and network infrastructure for the cluster.

.Public IPs for nodes
[IMPORTANT]
====
`skuba` cannot currently access nodes through a bastion host, so all
the nodes in the cluster must be directly reachable from the machine where
`skuba` is being run. We must also consider that `skuba` must use
the external IPs as `--target` when initializing or joining the cluster,
while we must specify the internal DNS names for registering the nodes
in the cluster.
====

.Note down IP/FQDN for nodes
[IMPORTANT]
====
The IP addresses of the generated machines will be displayed in the terraform
output during the cluster node deployment. You need these IP addresses to
deploy {productname} to the cluster.

If you need to find an IP addresses later on you can run `terraform output` within
the directory you performed the deployment from `~/my-cluster` directory or
perform the following steps:

. Log in to the AWS Console and click on menu:Load Balancers[]. Find the one with the
string you entered in the {tf} configuration above e.g. `testing-lb`.
. Note down the "DNS name".
+
. Now click on menu:Instances[].
. Using the menu:Filter[] text box, enter the string you specified for `stack_name`
in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
. Find the `IPv4 Public IP` on each of the nodes of your cluster.
