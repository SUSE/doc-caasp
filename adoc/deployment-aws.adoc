== Deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS) is currently a tech preview.

.Preparation Required
[NOTE]
====
You must have completed <<deployment.preparations>> to proceed.
====

You will use {tf} to deploy the whole infrastructure described in
<<architecture-aws>>. Then you will use the `skuba` tool to bootstrap the
{kube} cluster on top of it.


[[architecture-aws]]
=== AWS Deployment

The AWS deployment created by our {tf} template files leads to the
creation of the infrastructure described in the next paragraphs.

==== Network

All of the infrastructure is created inside of a user specified AWS region.
The resources are currently all located inside of the same availability
zone.

The {tf} template files create a dedicated Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (link:https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/[VPC])
with *two subnets*: "public" and "private". Instances inside of the *public subnet* have
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html[Elasic IP addresses]
associated, hence they are reachable from the internet. Instances inside of the *private subnet* are not reachable from the internet.
However they can still reach external resources; for example they can still
perform operations like downloading updates and pulling container images from
external container registries. Communication between the public and the private subnet is allowed.
All the control plane instances are currently located inside of the public
subnet. Worker instances are inside of the private subnet.

Both control plane and worker nodes have tailored
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html[Security Groups]
assigned to them. These are based on the networking requirements described
in <<sysreq-networking>>.

==== Load Balancer

The {tf} template files take care of creating a
link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[Classic Load Balancer]
which exposes the Kubernetes API service deployed on the control plane
nodes.

The load balancer exposes the following ports:

* `6443`: Kubernetes API server
* `32000`: Dex (OIDC Connect)
* `32001`: Gangway (RBAC Authenticate)

[[architecture-aws-vpc-peering]]
==== Join Already Existing VPCs

The {tf} template files allow the user to have the
{productname} VPC join one or more existing VPCs.

This is achieved by the creation of
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html[VPC peering links]
and dedicated
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html[Route tables].

This feature allows {productname} to access and be accessed by resources defined
inside of other VPCs. For example, this capability can be used to register all
the {productname} instances against a {susemgr} server running inside of a
private VPC.

Current limitations:

* The VPCs must belong to the same AWS region.
* The VPCs must be owned by the same user who is creating the {productname}
infrastructure via {tf}.

[[aws-iam-profile]]
==== IAM Profiles

The
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#aws[AWS Cloud Provider]
integration for {kube} requires special
link:https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[IAM] profiles to be associated with the control
plane and worker instances. {tf} can create these profiles or can leverage existing ones.
It all depends on the rights of the user invoking {tf}.

NOTE: Known issue: Current terrarform script does not properly create IAM resources, instead please follows the instruction in <<aws-iam-profile-cli>> to create IAM role, role policy, and instance profile. This limitation will be addressed in the following release. 

The {tf} link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html[AWS provider]
requires your credentials. These can be obtained by following these steps:

* Log in to the AWS console.
* Click on your username in the upper right hand corner to reveal the drop-down menu.
* Click on menu:My Security Credentials[].
* Click menu:Create Access Key[] on the "Security Credentials" tab.
* Note down the newly created _Access_ and _Secret_ keys.

[[aws-iam-profile-cli]]
=== Create IAM Role, Role Policy, and Instance Profile through AWS CLI

Users who do not have permission to create IAM role, role policy, and instance profile using terraform, devops should create them for you, using the instructions below:

=== Deploying the Infrastructure

On the management machine, find the {tf} template files for AWS in
`/usr/share/caasp/terraform/aws`. These files have been installed as part of
the management pattern (`sudo zypper in -t pattern SUSE-CaaSP-Management`).

Copy this folder to a location of your choice as the files need adjustment.

----
mkdir -p ~/caasp/deployment/
cp -r /usr/share/caasp/terraform/aws/ ~/caasp/deployment/
cd ~/caasp/deployment/aws/
----

Once the files are copied, rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to
`terraform.tfvars`:

----
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
----

Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and add/modify the following variables:

include::deployment-terraform-example.adoc[tags=tf_aws]

[TIP]
====
You can set timezone and other parameters before deploying the nodes
by modifying the cloud-init template:

* `~/caasp/deployment/aws/cloud-init/cloud-init.yaml.tpl`
====

You can enter the registration code for your nodes in
`~/caasp/deployment/aws/registration.auto.tfvars` instead of the
`terraform.tfvars` file.

Substitute `CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.

[source,json]
----
# SUSE CaaSP Product Key
caasp_registry_code = "<CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE>"
----

This is required so all the deployed nodes can automatically register
with {scc} and retrieve packages.

Now you can deploy the nodes by running:

----
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

Check the output for the actions to be taken. Type "yes" and confirm with
kbd:[Enter] when ready.
{tf} will now provision all the cluster infrastructure.

.Public IPs for Nodes
[IMPORTANT]
====
`skuba` currently cannot access nodes through a bastion host, so all
the nodes in the cluster must be directly reachable from the machine where
`skuba` is being run.
`skuba` could be run from one of the master nodes or from a pre-existing bastion
host located inside of a joined VPC as described in
<<architecture-aws-vpc-peering>>.
====

.Note Down IP/FQDN For the Nodes
[IMPORTANT]
====
The IP addresses and FQDN of the generated machines will be displayed in the
{tf} output during the cluster node deployment. You need these information
later to deploy {productname}.

These information can be obtained at any time by executing the
`terraform output` command within the directory from which you executed
{tf}.
====

=== Logging into the Cluster Nodes

Connecting to the cluster nodes can be accomplished only via SSH key-based
authentication thanks to the ssh-public key injection done earlier via
`cloud-init`. You can use the predefined `ec2-user` user to log in.

If the ssh-agent is running in the background, run:

----
ssh ec2-user@<node-ip-address>
----

Without the ssh-agent running, run:

----
ssh ec2-user@<node-ip-address> -i <path-to-your-ssh-private-key>
----

Once connected, you can execute commands using password-less `sudo`.
