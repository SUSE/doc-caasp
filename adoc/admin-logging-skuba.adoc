= Logging in skuba

One important part of deploying and maintaining a product is to have reliable
logs. Tools like `skuba` take the approach of printing the output to the
standard output directly. This is not just common practice, but it also has the
advantage that then the user has more flexibility on how to manage said output.

Thus, whenever throughout this guide we write a `skuba` command, take into
account that the output will be printed into the standard output. If you would
also like to have the logs stored somewhere else for later inspection, you can
use tools like `tee`. For example:

[source,bash]
----
skuba node bootstrap --user sles --sudo --target <IP/FQDN> <NODE_NAME> | tee <NODE_NAME>-skuba-node-bootstrap.log
----

Otherwise, you might want to use other tools to manage the logs for later
inspection. The point being that this guide will never consider how to manage
these logs because `skuba` itself does not. It's up to you to manage these logs
in any way you find desirable.

Moreover, `skuba` has also various levels of log verbosity. This is managed by
the `-v, --verbosity` flag. This flag accepts an integer argument, ranging from
0 to 5, where a higher number means a higher level of verbosity. If you don't
pass any arguments, then 0 is assumed. We recommend using the default argument,
since it will already log warnings and errors, among other relevant output,
whereas 5 can be a bit overwhelming. Thus, for the above example, we would
recommend something like:

[source,bash]
----
skuba node bootstrap -v --user sles --sudo --target <IP/FQDN> <NODE_NAME> | tee <NODE_NAME>-skuba-node-bootstrap.log
----

Now the `<NODE_NAME>-skuba-node-bootstrap.log` will have more useful information
than without the `-v` flag. We *strongly* recommend using this flag in order to
get as much useful information as possible from a single run.
