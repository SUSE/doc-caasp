=== Upgrades of OS components (automated)

By default {productname} clusters automatically apply all the patches that are marked as non
interactive. These patches are safe to be applied since they should not cause any side effect.

However, some patches need the nodes to be rebooted in order to be activated. This is the
case for example of kernel updates or some package updates (like glibc).

The nodes of the cluster have some metadata that is kept up-to-date by {productname}.
This metadata can be used by the cluster administrator to answer these questions:

* Does the node need to be rebooted to make some updates active?
* Does the node have non interactive updates pending?
* When was the check done last time?

Cluster administrators can get a quick overview of each cluster node by using one of the
following methods.

UI mode:

* Open a standard kubernetes UI (eg: ​kubernetes dashboard​).
* Click on the node.
* Look at the annotations associated to the node.

Text mode:

* Go to a machine with a working kubectl (meaning the user can connect to the cluster).
* Ensure you've the caasp kubectl plugin installed. This is a simple statically linked binary
that SUSE distributes alongside `skuba`.
* Execute the `kubectl caasp cluster status` command (or `skuba cluster status`).

The output of the command will look like that:

[source,bash]

==== Node reboots

Some updates require the node to be rebooted to make them active.

The {productname} cluster is configured by default to take advantage of ​kured​. This service looks for
nodes that have to be rebooted and, before doing the actual reboot, takes care of draining the
node.

Kured reboots one node per time. This ensures the rest of worker nodes won't be saturated when
adopting the being rebooted worker node workloads, as well as ensuring that etcd will always be
healthy in the case of control plane nodes.

Cluster administrators can integrate kured stats into a prometheus instance and create alerts,
charts and other personal customizations.

Cluster administrators can also fine tune the kured deployment to prevent its agent from
rebooting machines where special workloads are running. For example: it's possible to prevent kured
from rebooting nodes running computational workloads until their pods are done. To achieve
that it's necessary to instruct cluster users to add special labels to the pods they don't want to see
interrupted due to the node being rebooted.

==== Interactive upgrades

Some updates might cause damages to the running workloads. These interactive updates are
currently being referenced by this document as "disruptive upgrades".

Cluster administrators don't have to worry about disruptive upgrades. {productname} will
automatically apply them making sure no disruption is caused to the cluster.
That happens because nodes with disruptive upgrades are updated one at a time, similar to
when nodes are automatically rebooted. Moreover, {productname} will take care of draining and
cordoning the node before these updates are applied, and uncordoning it afterwards.

Disruptive upgrades could take some time to be automatically applied due to their sensitive
nature (nodes are updated one by one). Cluster operators can always see the status of all
nodes by looking at the annotations of the kubernetes nodes (see previous section).

By looking at node annotations a cluster administrator can answer the following questions:

* Does the node have pending disruptive upgrades?
* Are the disruptive upgrades being applied?

=== Upgrades of OS components (not automated)

It's possible to disable the automatic patch apply completely, if the user wants to inspect every
patch that will be applied to the cluster, so they are in complete control of when the cluster is
patched.
By default {productname} clusters have some updates applied automatically. Nodes can also be
rebooted in an automatic fashion under some circumstances.
To prevent that from happening it's possible to annotate nodes that are not desired to be automatically
rebooted. Any user with rights to annotate nodes will be able to configure this behavior.
Cluster administrators can use software like SUSE Manager to check the patching level of
the underlying operating system of any node.
When rebooting nodes, it's important to take some considerations into account:

* Ensure nodes are drained (and thus, cordoned) before they are rebooted, uncordon the nodes once they
are back
* Reboot master/etcd nodes one by one. Wait for the rebooted node to come back, make
sure etcd is in an healthy state before moving to the next etcd node (this can be done
using etcdctl)
* Do not reboot too many worker nodes at the same time to avoid the remaining ones to
be swamped by workloads

Cluster administrators have to follow the very same steps whenever a node has an
interactive (aka disruptive) upgrade pending.

=== Upgrades of the Kubernetes platform

The cluster administrator can check whether there's a new Kubernetes version available
distributed by SUSE, and in case there is, they can upgrade the cluster in a controlled way.

* In order to find out if there’s a new Kubernetes version available, the following command
will be executed in a machine that has access to the cluster definition folder:
** `skuba cluster upgrade plan`
* If there's a new version available, it will be reported in the terminal.
* In order to start the upgrade of the cluster, all commands should be executed from a
machine that contains the cluster definition folder, so that it contains an administrative kubeconfig file:
*** This command will confirm the target version to what the cluster will be applied if
the process is continued.
** It's necessary to upgrade all control plane nodes first, running:
** `skuba node upgrade apply --user sles --sudo --target <IP_ADDRESS/FQDN>`
*** This command has to be applied on all control plane nodes, one by one.
** It's necessary to upgrade all worker nodes last, running:
** `skuba node upgrade apply --user sles --sudo --target <IP_ADDRESS/FQDN>`
*** This command has to be applied on all worker nodes, one by one.
