=== Upgrades of OS components (automated)

By default {productname} clusters automatically apply all the patches that are marked as non
interactive. These patches are safe to be applied since they should not cause any side effect.

However, some patches need the nodes to be rebooted in order to be activated. This is the
case for example of kernel updates or some package updates (like glibc).

The nodes of the cluster have some metadata that is kept up-to-date by {productname}.
This metadata can be used by the system administrator to answer these questions:

* Does the node need to be rebooted to make some updates active?
* Does the node have pending non interactive updates?
* When was the check done last time?

System administrators can get a quick overview of each cluster node by using one of the
following methods.

UI mode:

* Open a standard kubernetes UI (eg: ​kubernetes dashboard​).
* Click on the node.
* Look at the annotations associated to the node.

Text mode:

* Go to a machine with a working kubectl (meaning I can connect to the cluster).
* Ensure I’ve the caasp kubectl plugin installed. This is a simple statically linked binary
that SUSE distributes as RPM.
* Execute the `kubectl caasp cluster status` command.

The output of the command will look like that:

[source,bash]

==== Node reboots

Some updates require the node to be rebooted to make them active. As a system administrator
I don’t have to worry about a thing.

The {productname} cluster is configured by default to take advantage of ​kured​. This service look for
nodes that have to be rebooted and, before doing the actual reboot, takes care of draining the
node.

Kured reboots one node per time. This ensures my worker nodes won’t be saturated and my
etcd cluster will always be in a healthy state.

System administrators can integrate kured stats into my prometheus instance and create alerts,
charts and other personal customizations.

System administrators can also fine tune the kured deployment to prevent its agent from
rebooting machines where special workloads are running. For example: I can prevent kured
from rebooting nodes running computational workloads until their pods are done. To achieve
that I just have to instruct all my users to add special labels to the pods they don’t want to see
interrupted due to the node being rebooted.

==== Interactive upgrades

Some updates might cause damages to the running workloads. These interactive updates are
currently being referenced by this document as “disruptive upgrades”.

System administrators don’t have to worry about disruptive upgrades. {productname} will
automatically apply them making sure no disruption is caused to the cluster.
That happens because nodes with disruptive upgrades are updated one at a time, a bit like
when nodes are automatically rebooted. Moreover {productname} will take care of draining the
node before these updates are applied, and cordoning it afterwards.

Disruptive upgrades could take some time to be automatically applied due to their sensitive
nature (nodes are updated one by one). As a system operator I can always see the status of my
nodes by looking at the annotations of the kubernetes nodes (see previous section).

By looking at node annotations a system administrator can answer the following questions:

* Does the node have pending disruptive upgrades?
* Are the disruptive upgrades being applied?

=== Upgrades of OS components (not automated)

As a systems administrator I want my cluster to be updated only when I consider it’s necessary,
with human intervention as a must for every package update, so that I’m in complete control of
when my cluster is updated.
By default {productname} clusters have some updates applied automatically. Nodes can also be
rebooted in an automatic fashion under some circumstances.
To prevent that from happening I can annotate nodes that are not desired to be automatically
rebooted. Any user with rights to annotate nodes will be able to configure this behavior.
System administrators can use software like SUSE Manager to check the patching level of
the underlying operative system of my nodes.
I can safely use SUSE Manager or other tools to apply all the non-interactive updates.
I have to follow SUSE {productname} guidelines when rebooting nodes:

* Ensure nodes are cordoned before they are rebooted, uncordon the nodes once they
are back
* Reboot master/etcd nodes one by one. Wait for the rebooted node to come back, make
sure etcd is in an healthy state before moving to the next etcd node (this can be done
using etcdctl)
* Do not reboot too many worker nodes at the same time to avoid the remaining ones to
be swamped by workloads

System administrators have to follow the very same steps whenever a node has an
interactive (aka disruptive) upgrade pending.
Intermediate levels of automation
As an operator I’m fine with having non-interactive updates applied, but I don’t want my nodes
to be automatically rebooted.
To prevent automatic reboots I can instruct kured to not reboot nodes. This can be done using a
simple kubectl command.
I can re-enable automatic reboots of the nodes using kured during my maintenance windows by
using the same kubectl command.

=== Upgrades of the Kubernetes platform
As a systems administrator I want to check whether there’s a new Kubernetes version available
distributed by SUSE, and in case there is, I want to upgrade to it in a controlled way.

* In order to find out if there’s a new Kubernetes version available, I will run the following
command in a machine that has access to the init configuration:
** `skuba cluster upgrade plan`
* If there’s a new version available, it will be reported in the terminal.
* I can now decide to upgrade the cluster as follows, all command executed from a
machine that contains the folder where `kubeadm cluster init` was executed, and with an
administrative kubeconfig file:
** Run `skuba cluster upgrade plan`, what will create a `kubeadm-upgrade.conf`
file that contains the new version of the stack aside from other information
present on the `kubeadm-init.conf` file generated by `skuba cluster init`
command.
** This command will confirm the target version to what the cluster will be applied if
the process is continued.
Once that I’m fine with the target version, I have to update all control plane nodes. For
every control plane instance, I have to run:
** `skuba node upgrade control-plane --target <fqdn/IP>`
**  This command will read the `kubeadm-upgrade.conf` file automatically and
perform the upgrade of the control plane components on the target node.
* Then, I will have to update the kubelet on all nodes, control plane instances and worker
nodes, by running the following command:
** `skuba node upgrade kubelet --target <fqdn/IP>`
** This command will read the `kubeadm-upgrade.conf` file automatically and
perform the upgrade of the kubelet on the target node.
