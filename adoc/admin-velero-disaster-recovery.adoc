= Backup and Restore with Velero

link:https://velero.io/[Velero] is a solution for supporting {kube} cluster disaster recovery,
data migration and data protection by backing up {kube} cluster resources and persistent volumes to externally supported storage backend on-demand or by schedule.

The major functions include:

* Backup {kube} resources and persistent volumes for supported storage providers
* Restore {kube} resources and persistent volumes for supported storage providers
* When backing up persistent volumes w/o supported storage provider, Velero leverages link:https://github.com/restic/restic[restic] as an agnostic solution to back up this sort of persistent volumes under some known limitations.

User can leverage these fundamental functions to achieve user stories:

* Backup whole {kube} cluster resources then restore if any {kube} resources loss
* Backup selected {kube} resources then restore if the selected {kube} resources loss
* Backup selected {kube} resources and persistent volumes then restore if the {kube} selected {kube} resources loss or data loss
* Migrate the backup to other clusters for any purpose like migrates production cluster to develop cluster for testing.

Velero consists of below components:

* A Velero server that runs on your {kube} cluster
* A `restic` deployed on each worker nodes that run on your {kube} cluster (optional)
* A command-line client that runs locally

== Limitations

. Velero doesn't overwrite objects in-cluster if they already exist.
. Velero supports a single set of credentials _per provider_.
It's not yet possible to use different credentials for different object storage locations for the same provider.
. Volume snapshots are limited by where your provider allows you to create snapshots.
For example, AWS and Azure do not allow you to create a volume snapshot in a different region than where the volume is located.
If you try to take a Velero backup using a volume snapshot location with a different region than where your cluster's volume is, the backup will fail.
. It is not yet possible to send a single Velero backup to multiple backup storage locations simultaneously, or a single volume snapshot to multiple locations simultaneously.
However, you can set up multiple backups manually or scheduled that differ only in the storage locations.
. Cross-provider snapshots are not supported. If you have a cluster with more than one type of volume (e.g. NFS and Ceph), but you only have a volume snapshot location configured for NFS, then Velero will _only_ snapshot the NFS volumes.
. `Restic` data is stored under a prefix/subdirectory of the main Velero bucket and will go into the bucket corresponding backup storage location selected by the user at backup creation time.
. When recovering, the {kube} version, Velero version (includes container version), and Helm version have to be _exactly_ the same as the original cluster.
. When performing cluster migration, the new cluster number of nodes should be equal or greater than the original cluster.

== Uninstall
Remove the Velero server deployment and `restic` DaemonSet if it exists.
Then, delete Velero custom resource definitions (CRDs).
