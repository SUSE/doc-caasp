== Introduction

Logging is ubiquitous throughout {productname}. Some tools will only print their
outputs to the currently running session shell and not create a "log file".

If you need to retain the output of these files you can `tee` them into a separate file (refer to <<tee-logging>>).

Many other service components will produce log files or other log info streams.
You can collect, store and evaluate these logs via <<centralized-logging>> for
use with the <<monitoring-stack>>.
