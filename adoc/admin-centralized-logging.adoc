= Centralized Logging


Centralized Logging is a means of collecting logs from CaaS Platform for centralized management. It forwards system and Kubernetes cluster logs to a specified external logging service, for example, Rsyslog server.

Collecting logs in a central location can serve for audit or debug purposes or to analyze and visual present the data.
