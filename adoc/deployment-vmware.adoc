== Deployment on VMware

.Preparation Required
[NOTE]
You must have completed <<deployment.preparations>> to proceed.

=== Environment description

[NOTE]
====
These instructions are based on `VMware ESXi {vmware_version}`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
These instructions currently do not describe how to set up a load balancer.
This will be added in future versions. You must provide your own load balancing
solution that directs access to the master nodes.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
VMware vSPhere doesn't offer a load-balancer solution. Please expose port `6443`
for the {kube} api-servers on the master nodes on a local load balancer using
round-robin 1:1 port forwarding.
====

=== VM preparation for creating a template

. Upload the ISO image {isofile} to desired VMware datastore.

Now you can create a new base VM for {productname} within the designated resource
pool through the vSphere WebUI:

. Create a "New Virtual Machine".
. Define a name for the virtual machine (VM).
+

. Select the folder where the VM will be stored.
. Select a `Compute Resource` that will run the VM.
+

==== Preparation of the VM as a template

In order to run {productname} on the created VMs, you must configure and install some additional packages
like `sudo`, `cloud-init` and `open-vm-tools`.

.Activate extensions during {sle} installation with YaST
[TIP]
Steps 1-4 may be skipped, if they were already performed in YaST during the {sle} installation.

. Register the SLES15-SP1 system. Substitute `CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.
+
----
SUSEConnect -r CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE
----
. Register the `Containers` module (free of charge)
+
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.1/x86_64
----
. Register the `Public Cloud` module for basic `cloud-init` package (free of charge)
+
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.1/x86_64
----
. Register the {productname} module. Substitute `CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.
+
----
SUSEConnect -p caasp/4.0/x86_64 -r CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE
----
. Install required packages. As root, run:
+
----
zypper in sudo cloud-init cloud-init-vmware-guestinfo open-vm-tools
----
. Enable the installed `cloud-init` services. As root, run:
+
----
systemctl enable cloud-init cloud-init-local cloud-config cloud-final
----

. Deregister from `scc`:
+
----
SUSEConnect -d; SUSEConnect --cleanup
----

. Do a cleanup of the SLE image for converting into a VMware template. As root, run:
+
----
rm /etc/machine-id /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId \
/var/lib/systemd/random-seed /var/lib/dbus/machine-id \
/var/lib/wicked/*
----
. Cleanup btrfs snapshots and create one with initial state:
+
----
snapper list
snapper delete <list_of_nums_of_unneeded_snapshots>
snapper create -d "Initial snapshot for caasp template" -t single
----
. Power down the VM. As root, run:
+
----
shutdown -h now
----

==== Creating the VMware Template

Now you can convert the VM into a template in VMware (or repeat this action block for each VM).

. In the vSphere WebUI, right-click on the VM and select menu:Template[Convert to Template].
Name it reasonably so you can later identify the template. The template will be created.

=== Deploying VMs from the Template

==== Terraform

. Find the {tf} template files for {soc} in `/usr/share/caasp/terraform/vmware` (which was installed as part of the management
pattern (`sudo zypper in patterns-caasp-Management`)).
Copy this folder to a location of your choice as the files need adjustment.
+
----
mkdir -p ~/caasp/deployment/
cp -r /usr/share/caasp/terraform/vmware/ ~/caasp/deployment/
cd ~/caasp/deployment/vmware/
----
. Once the files are copied, rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to
`terraform.tfvars`:
+
----
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
----
. Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and add modify the following variables:
+
include::deployment-terraform-example.adoc[tag=tf_vmware]
. Enter the registration code for your nodes in `~/my-cluster/registration.auto.tfvars`:
+
Substitute `CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.
+
[source,json]
----
# SUSE CaaSP Product Registration Code
caasp_registry_code = "CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE"
----
+
This is required so all the deployed nodes can automatically register to {scc} and retrieve packages.

Once the files are adjusted, `terraform` needs to know about the `vSphere` server
and the login details for it; these can be exported as environment variables or
entered every time `terraform` is invoked.

Additionally, the `ssh-key` that is specified in the `tfvars` file must be added
to the keyring, so the machine running `skuba` can `ssh` into the machines:

----
export VSPHERE_SERVER="<server_address"
export VSPHERE_USER="<username>"
export VSPHERE_PASSWORD="<password>"
export VSPHERE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSL=true # In case you are using custom certificate for accessing vsphere API

ssh-add <path_to_private_ssh_key_from_tfvars>
----

Run terraform to create the required machines for use with `skuba`:

----
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

==== Setup by hand
For each VM deployment follow the {ay} installation method used for deployment on
Bare metal machines as described in <<deployment_bare_metal>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to give each VM in VMware a clear name that shows it's purpose in the cluster e.g.

* `caasp-master-0`
* `caasp-worker-0`
* `caasp-worker-1`

You will need these names during bootstrapping of the cluster.
====
. Power on the newly created VMs.
. You need to know the FQDN/IP for each of the created VMs during the bootstrap process.
