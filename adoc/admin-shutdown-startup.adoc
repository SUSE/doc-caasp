= Shutdown & Startup

Instructions to safely shutdown and startup a cluster.

Shutting down::
- Take a link:{docurl}/single-html/caasp-admin/#_backup[backup]
- Scale all applications down to zero.
- Drain/cordon all nodes except for control plane.
- Shut down worker nodes nodes.
- Shut down control plane nodes.

Starting up::
- Start all control plane nodes.
- Wait for them to come online and are on a healthy status.
- Start all worker nodes.
[NOTE]
This process should already take care of removing the `cordon` flag on the nodes, it will be necessary to run the command (i.e., `kubectl uncordon <NODE>`) manually.
