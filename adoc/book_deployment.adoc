== Deployment Instructions

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are installing over one of the previous milestones you must remove the
RPM repository. {productname} is now distributed as an extension for
{sle} and no longer requires the separate repository.

If you do not remove the repository before installation, there might be conflicts
with the package dependencies that can render you installation nonfunctional.
