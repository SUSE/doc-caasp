== Deployment Instructions

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are installing over one of the previous milestones,  you must remove the
RPM repository. {productname} is now distributed as an extension for
{sle} and no longer requires the separate repository.

If you do not remove the repository before installation, there might be conflicts
with the package dependencies that could render your installation nonfunctional.
====

[NOTE]
====
Due to a naming convention conflict, all versions of {productname} 4.x up to 4.5 will be released in the `4.0` module.
Starting with 4.5 the product will be delivered in the `4.5` module.
