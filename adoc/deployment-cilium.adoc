= Cilium

The main characteristic of &cilium; is using &ebpf;
 (<link xlink:href="https://opensource.com/article/17/9/intro-ebpf">extended Berkeley Packet Filter</link>)
 as a mechanism for filtering incoming and outgoing packets in containers.
 &ebpf; is a bytecode interpreter inside Linux kernel which allows to write
 programs to analyze, filter network packets and to monitor system function
 calls. &cilium; translates &net_pols; into &ebpf; programs which are loaded
into the kernel.
