== Network Policies

[NOTE]
====
{productname} versions 4.0 and 4.1 support L3 and L4 policy management; the hyperlinks below will refer you to Cilium documentation on creating these policies, as Cilium documentation is an excellent and definitive source.

The default behavior of {kube} is that all pods can see all other pods within a cluster, whether those pods are hosted by the same {kube} node or different ones.
This behavior is intentional, and aids greatly in the development process as the complexity of networking is effectively removed from both the developer and the operator.

However, when a workload is deployed in a {kube} cluster in production, any number of reasons may arise leading to the need to isolate some workloads from others.
For example, if a Human Resources department is running workloads processing PII (Personally Identifiable Information), those workloads should not by default be accessible by any other workload in the cluster.

Network policies are the mechanism provided by {kube} which allow a cloud operator to isolate workloads from each other in a variety of ways.
For example, a policy could be defined which only allows a database server workload to be accessed only by the web servers whose pages use the data in the database.
Another policy could be defined in the cluster which allows only web browsers outside the cluster to access the web server workloads in the cluster and so on.

To implement network policies, a network plugin must be correctly integrated into the cluster. {productname} incorporates Cilium as its supported network policy management plugin.
For L3 and L4 Cilium leverages link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/index.html[BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)] where every bit of communication transits through a packet processing engine in the kernel. For L7 network policies, Cilium leverages an Envoy proxy running together with the cilium-agent. Other policy management plugins in the {kube} ecosystem leverage `iptables`.

{suse} has supported `iptables` since its inception in the Linux world, but believes BPF brings sufficiently compelling advantages (fine-grained control, performance) over `iptables`.
Not only does Cilium have performance benefits brought on by BPF, it also has benefits far higher in the network stack.

The most typically used policies in {kube} cover L3 and L4 events in the network stack, allowing workloads to be protected by specifying IP addresses and TCP ports.
To implement the earlier example of a dedicated webserver accessing a critical secured database, an L3 policy would be define allowing a web server workload running at IP address `192.168.0.1` to access a MySQL database workload running at IP address `192.168.0.2` on TCP port `3306`.
