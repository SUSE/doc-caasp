If you plan to deploy {suse} {cap} on your {productname}
cluster please skip this section of the documentation and refer
to the official {suse} {cap} instructions. This will include Stratos.

== Introduction

The Stratos user interface (UI) is a modern web-based management application for
{kube} and for Cloud Foundry distributions based on {kube} like {suse} {cap}.

Stratos provides a graphical management console for both developers and system
administrators.

A single Stratos instance can be used to monitor multiple {kube} clusters
as long as it is granted access to their {kube} API endpoint.

This document aims to describe how to install Stratos in a {productname} cluster
that doesn't plan to run any {suse} {cap} components.

The Stratos stack is deployed using a helm charts and consists of its web
UI POD and a MariaDB one that is used to store configuration values.

== Prerequisites

=== Helm

The deployment of Stratos is performed using a helm chart. Your remote
administration machine must have Helm installed.

When using a Helm release earlier than 3.0, Helm's Tiller component has to be
installed and active on your {productname} cluster.

=== Persistent Storage

The MariaDB instance used by Stratos requires a persistent storage to store
its data.

The cluster must have a {kube} Storage Class defined.

== Installation

=== Adding helm chart repository and default values

. Add SUSE helm charts repository
+
[source,bash]
----
helm repo add suse https://kubernetes-charts.suse.com
----
+
. Obtain the default `values.yaml` file of the helm chart
+
[source,bash]
----
helm inspect values suse/console > stratos-values.yaml
----

=== Define `admin` user password

Create a secure password for your admin user and write that into the
`stratos-values.yaml` as value of the `console.localAdminPassword` key.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This step is required to allow the installation of Stratos without
having any {suse} {cap} components deployed on the cluster.
====

=== Define the Storage Class to be used

If your cluster does not have a default storage class configured, or you want
to use a different one, follow these instructions.

Open the `stratos-values.yaml` file and look for the `storageClass` entry
defined at the global level, uncomment the line and provide the name of your
Storage Class.

The values file will have something like that:

[source,yaml]
----
# Specify which storage class should be used for PVCs
storageClass: default
----

[NOTE]
====
The file has other `storageClass` keys defined inside of some of
its resources. These can be left empty to rely on the global Storage Class that
has just been defined.
====

=== Exposing the Web UI

The web interface of Stratos can be exposed either via a Ingress resource or
by using a Service of type `LoadBalancer` or even both at the same time.

An Ingress controller must be deployed on the cluster to be able to expose
the service using an Ingress resource.

The cluster must be deployed on a platform that can handle `LoadBalancer`
objects and must have the Cloud Provider Integration (CPI) enabled. This
can be achieved, for example, when deploying {productname} on top of OpenStack.

The behavior is defined inside of the `console.service` stanza of the yaml file:

[source,yaml]
----
console:
  service:
    annotations: []
    externalIPs: []
    loadBalancerIP:
    loadBalancerSourceRanges: []
    servicePort: 443
    # nodePort: 30000
    type: ClusterIP
    externalName:
    ingress:
      ## If true, Ingress will be created
      enabled: false

      ## Additional annotations
      annotations: {}

      ## Additional labels
      extraLabels: {}

      ## Host for the ingress
      # Defaults to console.[env.Domain] if env.Domain is set and host is not
      host:

      # Name of secret containing TLS certificate
      secretName:

      # crt and key for TLS Certificate (this chart will create the secret based on these)
      tls:
        crt:
        key:
----

==== Expose the web UI using a LoadBalancer

The service can be exposes as a `LoadBalancer` one by setting the value of
`console.service.type` to be `LoadBalancer`.

The `LoadBalancer` resource can be tuned by changing the values of the other
`loadBalancer*` params specified inside of the `console.service` stanza.

==== Expose the web UI using an Ingress

The Ingress resource can be created by setting
`console.service.ingress.enabled` to be `true`.

Stratos is exposed by the Ingress using a dedicated host rule. Hence
you must specify the FQDN of the host as a value of the
`console.service.ingress.host` key.

The behavior of the Ingress object can be fine tuned by using the
other keys inside of the `console.service.ingress` stanza.

=== Securing Stratos

It's highly recommended to secure Stratos' web interface using TLS encryption.

This can be done by creating a TLS certificate for Stratos.

==== Secure Stratos web UI

It's highly recommended to secure the web interface of Stratos by using TLS
encryption. This can be easily done when exposing the web interface using an
Ingress resource.

Inside of the `console.service.ingress` stanza ensure the Ingress resource is
enabled and then specify values for `console.service.ingress.tls.crt` and
`console.service.ingress.tls.key`. These keys hold the base64 encoded TLS
certificate and key.

The TLS certificate and key can be base64 encoded by using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
base64 tls.crt
base64 tls.key
----

The output produced by the two commands has to be copied into the
`stratos-values.yaml` file, resulting in something like that:

[source,yaml]
----
console:
  service:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      tls: |
        <output of base64 tls.crt>
      key: |
        <output of base64 tls.key>
----

==== Change MariaDB password

The helm chart provisions the MariaDB database with a default weak password.
A stronger password can be specified by altering the value of `mariadb.mariadbPassword`.

=== Enable tech preview features

You can enable tech preview features of Stratos by changing the value of
`console.techPreview` from `false` to `true`.

=== Deploying Stratos

Now Stratos can be deployed using helm and the values specified inside of the
`stratos-values.yaml` file:

[source,bash]
----
helm install suse/console \
  --name stratos-console \
  --namespace stratos \
  --values stratos-values.yaml
----

You can monitor the status of your Stratos deployment with the watch command:

[source,bash]
----
watch --color 'kubectl get pods --namespace stratos'
----

When Stratos is successfully deployed, the following is observed:

  * For the volume-migration pod, the STATUS is Completed and the READY column is at 0/1.
  * All other pods have a Running STATUS and a READY value of n/n.

Press `Ctrlâ€“C` to exit the watch command.

. At this stage Stratos web UI should be accessible. You can log into that using
the `admin` user and the password you specified inside of your `stratos-values.yaml`
file.

== Stratos configuration

Now that Stratos is up and running you can log into it and configure it to
connect to your {kube} cluster(s).
