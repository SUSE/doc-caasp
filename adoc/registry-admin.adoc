Setup Administration Access

SUSE Private Registry User Interface can be accessed from a supported web browser at the location provided as <ingress_url> during the installation. Default password for admin user is Harbor12345.

After the first login, you can change the administrator's password through the web UI: use "admin" tab and select "Change Password".

Harbor supports different modes for authenticating users and managing user accounts. SUSE Private Registry Technical Preview currently supports only Database Authentication type, where the users are stored in the Harbor database. Read more about managing users in Database mode in the upstream documentation.
