= Access Control

Users access the API using `kubectl`, client libraries, or by making REST requests.
Both human users and {kube} service accounts can be authorized for API access.
When a request reaches the API, it goes through several stages, that can be explained with the following three questions:

. Authentication: *who are you?* This is accomplished via <<authentication>> to validate the user's entity and respond to the corresponding user group after successful login.
. Authorization: *what kind of access do you have?* This is accomplished via <<rbac>> API, that is a set of permissions for the previously authenticated user. Permissions are purely additive (there are no "deny" rules). A role can be defined within a namespace with a Role, or cluster-wide with a ClusterRole.
. Admission Control: *what are you trying to do?* This is accomplished via <<admission>>. They can modify (mutate) or validate (accept or reject) requests.

Unlike authentication and authorization, if any admission controller rejects, then the request is immediately rejected.

Users can access with a Web browser or command line to do the authentication or self-configure `kubectl` to access authorized resources.

== Authentication and Authorization Flow

Authentication is composed of:

* *Dex* (https://github.com/dexidp/dex) is an identity provider service
(idP) that uses OIDC (Open ID Connect: https://openid.net/connect/)
to drive authentication for client applications.
It acts as a portal to defer authentication to the provider through connected
identity providers (connectors).
* *Client*:
  . Web browser: *Gangway* (https://github.com/heptiolabs/gangway):
  a Web application that enables authentication flow for your {productname}.
  The user can log in, authorize access, download `kubeconfig`, or self-configure `kubectl`.
  . Command-line: `skuba auth login`, a CLI application that enables authentication flow for your {productname}. The user can log in, authorize access, and get `kubeconfig`.

For authorization (Role-Based Access Control, RBAC), administrators can use `kubectl` to create corresponding
`RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` for a user or group to limit resource access.

=== Web Flow
image::oidc_flow_web.png[]
// Source: suse-rbac-oidc-flow-web.xml (open with http://draw.io/app)

. The user requests access through Gangway.
. Gangway redirects to Dex.
. Dex redirects to a connected identity provider (connector).
User login and a request to approve access are generated.
. Dex continues with OIDC authentication flow on behalf of the user
and creates/updates data to {kube} CRDs.
. Dex redirects the user to Gangway.
This redirect includes (ID/refresh) tokens.
. Gangway returns a link to download `kubeconfig` or self-configures `kubectl`
instructions to the user.

. User downloads `kubeconf` or self-configures `kubectl`.
. User uses `kubectl` to connect to the {kube} API server.
. {kube} CRDs validate the {kube} API server request and return a response.
. The `kubectl` connects to the authorized {kube} resources through the {kube} API server.

=== CLI Flow

// Source: suse-rbac-oidc-flow-cli.xml (open with http://draw.io/app)

. User requests access through `skuba auth login` with the Dex server URL,
username and password.
. Dex uses received username and password to log in and approve the access
request to the connected identity providers (connectors).
. Dex continues with the OIDC authentication flow on behalf of the user and
creates/updates data to the {kube} CRDs.
. Dex returns the ID token and refreshes token to `skuba auth login`.
. `skuba auth login` generates the kubeconfig file `kubeconf.txt`.
. User uses `kubectl` to connect the {kube} API server.
. {kube} CRDs validate the {kube} API server request and return a response.
. The `kubectl` connects to the authorized {kube} resources through {kube} API server.
