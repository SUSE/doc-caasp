----
<1> `stack_name`: Prefix for all machines of the cluster spawned by terraform.
<2> `internal_net` the internal network name that will be created/used for the cluster in {soc}.
*Note*: This string will be used to generate the human readable IDs in {soc}.
If you use a generic term it is very likely to fail deployment because the term is already in use by someone else. It's a good idea to use your username or other unique identifier.
<3> `masters`: Number of master nodes to be deployed.
<4> `workers`: Number of worker nodes to be deployed.
*Note*: Leave this the default `sles`. The username must exist on the used base operating system. It will not be created.
<5> `repositories`: A list of additional repositories to be added on each
machines - leave empty if no additional packages need to be installed.
<6> `packages`: Additional packages to be installed on the node.
*Note*: Do not remove any of the pre-filled values in the `packages` section. This can render
your cluster unusable. You can add more packages but do not remove any of the
default packages listed.
<7> `authorized_keys`: List of ssh-public-keys that will be able to login to the
deployed machines.
<8> `ntp_servers`: A list of `ntp` servers you would like to use with `chrony`.
