== Handling Updates

=== Updating Kubernetes Components

Updating of {kube} components is handled via `skuba`.

==== Generating and Overview of Available Updates

In order to get an overview of the updates available, you can run:

----
skuba cluster upgrade plan
----

This will show you a list of updates (if available) for different components
installed on the cluster. If the cluster is already running the latest available
versions, the output should look like this:

----
skuba version: 0.7.1 (release)  20190712 go1.12.6
Current Kubernetes cluster version: 1.15.0
Latest Kubernetes version: 1.15.0

Congratulations! You are already at the latest version available
----

If the cluster has a new patch-level and minor {kube} version available, the
output should look like this:

----
skuba version: 0.7.1 (release)  20190712 go1.12.6
Current Kubernetes cluster version: 1.14.1
Latest Kubernetes version: 1.15.0
Upgrade path to update from 1.14.1 to 1.15.0:
 - 1.14.1 -> 1.14.2
 - 1.14.2 -> 1.15.0
----

Similarly, you can also fetch this information on a per-node basis with the following command:

----
skuba node upgrade plan <node>
----

For example, if the cluster has a node named `worker0` which is running the latest available versions, the output should look like this:

----
skuba version: 0.7.1 (release)  20190712 go1.12.6
Current Kubernetes cluster version: 1.15.0
Latest Kubernetes version: 1.15.0

Node worker0 is up to date
----

On the other hand, if this same node has a new patch-level or minor {kube} version available, the output should look like this:

----
skuba version: 0.7.1 (release)  20190712 go1.12.6
Current Kubernetes cluster version: 1.14.1
Latest Kubernetes version: 1.15.0

Component versions in worker0
  - kubelet: 1.13.7 -> 1.14.1
  - cri-o: 1.13.7 -> 1.14.1
----

You will get a similar output if there is a version available on a master node
(named `master0` in this example):

----
skuba version: 0.7.1 (release)  20190712 go1.12.6
Current Kubernetes cluster version: 1.15.0
Latest Kubernetes version: 1.14.1

Component versions in master0
  - apiserver: 1.14.1 -> 1.15.0
  - controller-manager: 1.14.1 -> 1.15.0
  - scheduler: 1.14.1 -> 1.15.0
  - etcd: 3.3.11 -> 3.3.11
  - kubelet: 1.14.1 -> 1.15.0
  - cri-o: 1.14.1 -> 1.15.0
----

It may happen that the {kube} version on the control plane is too outdated
for the update to progress.
In this case, you would get output similar to the following:

----
skuba version: 0.7.1 (release)  20190712 go1.12.6
Current Kubernetes cluster version: 1.15.0
Latest Kubernetes version: 1.15.0

Unable to plan node upgrade: at least one control plane does not tolerate the current cluster version
----


[TIP]
=====
The control plane consists of these components:

* apiserver
* controller-manager
* scheduler
* etcd
* kubelet
* cri-o
=====


=== Updating Nodes

Updates have to be applied separately to each node, starting with the control
plane all the way down to the worker nodes.

Note that the upgrade via `skuba node upgrade apply` will:

* Upgrade the containerized control plane.
* Upgrade the rest of the {kube} system stack (`kubelet`, `cri-o`).
* Restart services.

During the upgrade to a newer version, the API server will be unavailable so it
is recommended to remove the node you are upgrading from the load balancer pool
before the upgrade to avoid any connection issues.

During the upgrade all the pods in the worker node will be restarted so it is
recommended to drain the pods if your application requires high availability.
In most cases, the restart is handled by replicaSet.


==== How To Update Nodes

. Upgrade the master nodes:
+
----
skuba node upgrade apply --target <master-node-ip> --user <user> --sudo
----
+
. When all master nodes are upgraded, upgrade the worker nodes as well:
+
----
skuba node upgrade apply --target <worker-node-ip> --user <user> --sudo
----
+
. Verify that your cluster nodes are upgraded by running:
+
----
skuba cluster upgrade plan
----

=== Base OS Updates

[TIP]
====
The upgrade via `skuba node upgrade apply` will:

* upgrade the containerized control plane.
* upgrade the rest of the {kube} system stack (`kubelet`, `cri-o`).
* restart services.
====

Base operating system updates are handled by `skuba-update`, which works together
with the `kured` reboot daemon.

==== Disabling Automatic Updates

Nodes added to a cluster have the service `skuba-update.timer`, which is responsible for running automatic updates, activated by default.
This service calls the `skuba-update` utility and it can be configured with the `/etc/sysconfig/skuba-update` file.
To disable the automatic updates on a node, simply `ssh` to it and then configure the skuba-update service by editing the `/etc/sysconfig/skuba-update` file with the following runtime options:

----
## Path           : System/Management
## Description    : Extra switches for skuba-update
## Type           : string
## Default        : ""
## ServiceRestart : skuba-update
#
SKUBA_UPDATE_OPTIONS="--annotate-only"
----

[TIP]
It is not required to reload or restart `skuba-update.timer`.

The `--annotate-only` flag makes the `skuba-update` utility only check if updates are available and annotate the node accordingly.
When this flag is activated no updates are installed at all.

==== Completely Disabling Reboots

If you would like to take care of reboots manually, either as a temporary measure or permanently, you can disable them by creating a lock:

----
kubectl -n kube-system annotate ds kured weave.works/kured-node-lock='{"nodeID":"manual"}'
----

This command modifies an annotation (`annotate`) on the daemonset (`ds`) named `kured`.

==== Manual Unlock

In exceptional circumstances, such as a node experiencing a permanent failure whilst rebooting, manual intervention may be required to remove the cluster lock:

----
kubectl -n kube-system annotate ds kured weave.works/kured-node-lock-
----

This command modifies an annotation (`annotate`) on the daemonset (`ds`) named `kured`.
It explicitly performs an "unset" (`-`) for the value for the annotation named `weave.works/kured-node-lock`.
