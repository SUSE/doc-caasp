= Health Checks

Although {kube} cluster takes care of a lot of the traditional deployment
problems on its own, it is good practice to monitor the availability
and health of your services and applications in order to react
to problems should they go beyond the automated measures.

A very basic (visual) health check can be achieved by accessing cAdvisor
on the admin node at port `4194`.
This will display a basic statistics UI about the cluster resources.

A complete set of instructions on how to monitor and maintain the health of
you cluster is beyond the scope of this document. More information is available
at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/#cadvisor

There are three levels of health checks.

* Cluster
* Node
* Service / Application

== Cluster Health Checks

The basic check if a cluster is working correctly is based on a few criteria:

* Are all services running as expected?
* Is there at least one {kube} master fully working? Even if the deployment is
configured to be highly available, it's useful to know if
`kube-controller-manager` is down on one of the machines.

[NOTE]

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-cluster/
====

=== {kube} master

All components in {kube} cluster expose a `/healthz` endpoint. The expected
(healthy) HTTP response status code is `200`.

The minimal services for the master to work properly are:

- kube-apiserver:
+
The component that receives your requests from `kubectl` and from the rest of
the {kube} components. The URL is https://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:6443/healthz
+
* Local Check
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k -i https://localhost:6443/healthz
----
* Remote Check
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k -i https://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:6443/healthz
----

- kube-controller-manager:
+
The component that contains the control loop, driving current state to the
desired state. The URL is http://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:10252/healthz
+
* Local Check
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://localhost:10252/healthz
----
* Remote Check
+
Make sure firewall allows port `10252`.
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:10252/healthz
----

- kube-scheduler:
+
The component that schedules workloads to nodes. The URL is
http://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:10251/healthz
+
* Local Check
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://localhost:10251/healthz
----
* Remote Check
+
Make sure firewall allows port `10251`.
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:10251/healthz
----

.High-Availability Environments
[NOTE]
====
In a HA environment you can monitor `kube-apiserver` on
`https://<LOAD-BALANCER-IP/FQDN>:6443/healthz`.

If any one of the master nodes is running correctly, you will receive a valid response.

This does, however, not mean that all master nodes necessarily work correctly.
To ensure that all master nodes work properly, the health checks must be
repeated individually for each deployed master node.

This endpoint will return a successful HTTP response if the cluster is
operational; otherwise it will fail.
It will for example check that it can access `etcd`.
This should not be used to infer that the overall cluster health is ideal.
It will return a successful response even when only minimal operational
cluster health exists.

To probe for full cluster health, you must perform individual health
checking for all machines.
====

=== ETCD Cluster

The etcd cluster exposes an endpoint `/health`. The expected (healthy)
HTTP response body is `{"health":"true"}`. The etcd cluster is accessed through
HTTPS only, so be sure to have etcd certificates.

- Local Check
+
[source,bash]
----
curl --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
--cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt
--key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key https://localhost:2379/health
----
- Remote Check
+
Make sure firewall allows port `2379`.
+
[source,bash]
----
curl --cacert <etcd-root-ca-cert> --cert <etcd-client-cert>
--key <etcd-client-key> https://<CONTROL-PLANE-IP/FQDN>:2379/health
----

== Node Health Checks

This basic node health check consists of two parts. It checks:

. The *kubelet endpoint*
. *CNI (Container Networking Interface) pod state*

=== kubelet

First, determine if kubelet is up and working on the node.

Kubelet has two ports exposed on all machines:

* Port https/10250: exposes kubelet services to the entire cluster and
is available from all nodes through authentication.
* Port http/10248: is only available on local host.

You can send an HTTP request to the endpoint to find out if
kubelet is healthy on that machine. The expected (healthy) HTTP response
status code is `200`.

==== Local Check

If there is an agent running on each node, this agent can simply
fetch the local healthz port:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://localhost:10248/healthz
----

==== Remote Check

There are two ways to fetch endpoints remotely (metrics, healthz, etc.).
Both methods use HTTPS and a token.

*The first method* is executed against the APIServer and mostly used with Prometheus
and Kubernetes discovery `kubernetes_sd_config`.
It allows automatic discovery of the nodes and avoids the task of defining monitoring
for each node. For more information see the {kube} documentation:
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config

*The second method* directly talks to kubelet and can be used in more traditional
monitoring where one must configure each node to be checked.

* *Configuration and Token retrieval:*
+
Create a Service Account (`monitoring`) with an associated secondary Token
(`monitoring-secret-token`). The token will be used in HTTP requests to authenticate
against the API server.
+
This Service Account can only fetch information about nodes and pods.
Best practice is not to use the token that has been created default. Using a secondary
token is also easier for management. Create a file [path]`kubelet.yaml` with
the following as content.
+
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: monitoring
  namespace: kube-system
secrets:
- name: monitoring-secret-token
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: monitoring-clusterrole
  namespace: kube-system
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
  - nodes/metrics
  - nodes/proxy
  - pods
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
- nonResourceURLs: ["/metrics", "/healthz", "/healthz/*"]
  verbs: ["get"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: monitoring-clusterrole-binding
  namespace: kube-system
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: monitoring-clusterrole
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: monitoring
  namespace: kube-system
----
+
Apply the yaml file:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f kubelet.yaml
----
Export the token to an environment variable:
+
[source,bash]
----
TOKEN=$(kubectl -n kube-system get secrets monitoring-secret-token
-o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
----
+
This token can now be passed through the `--header` argument as: "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN".
+
Now export important values as environment variables:
+

* *Environment Variables Setup*
. Choose a Kubernetes master node or worker node. The `NODE_IP_FQDN` here must
be a node's IP address or FQDN. The `NODE_NAME` here must be a node name in
your Kubernetes cluster. Export the variables `NODE_IP_FQDN` and `NODE_NAME`
so it can be reused.
+
[source,bash]
----
NODE_IP_FQDN="10.86.4.158"
NODE_NAME=worker0
----
+
. Retrieve the TOKEN with kubectl.
+
[source,bash]
----
TOKEN=$(kubectl -n kube-system get secrets monitoring-secret-token
-o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
----

. Get the control plane <IP/FQDN> from the configuration file. You can skip this
step if you only want to use the kubelet endpoint.
+
[source,bash]
----
CONTROL_PLANE=$(kubectl config view | grep server | cut -f 2- -d ":" | tr -d " ")
----
+
Now the key information to retrieve data from the endpoints should be available
in the environment and you can poll the endpoints.

* *Fetching Information from kubelet Endpoint*
+
. Make sure firewall allows port `10250`.
+
. Fetching metrics
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k https://$NODE_IP_FQDN:10250/metrics --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
----

. Fetching cAdvisor
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k https://$NODE_IP_FQDN:10250/metrics/cadvisor --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
----

. Fetching healthz
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k https://$NODE_IP_FQDN:10250/healthz --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
----

* *Fetching Information from APISERVER Endpoint*
+
. Fetching metrics
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k $CONTROL_PLANE/api/v1/nodes/$NODE_NAME/proxy/metrics --header
"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
----

. Fetching cAdvisor
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k $CONTROL_PLANE/api/v1/nodes/$NODE_NAME/proxy/metrics/cadvisor --header
"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
----

. Fetching healthz
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k $CONTROL_PLANE/api/v1/nodes/$NODE_NAME/proxy/healthz --header
"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
----

=== CNI

You can check if the CNI (Container Networking Interface) is working as expected
by check if the `coredns` service is running. If CNI has some kind of trouble
`coredns` will not be able to start:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get deployments -n kube-system
NAME              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cilium-operator   1/1     1            1           8d
coredns           2/2     2            2           8d
oidc-dex          1/1     1            1           8d
oidc-gangway      1/1     1            1           8d
----

If `coredns` is running and you are able to create pods then you can be certain
that CNI and your CNI plugin are working correctly.

There's also the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/monitor-node-health/[Monitor Node Health] check.
This is a `DaemonSet` that runs on every node, and reports to the `apiserver` back as
`NodeCondition` and `Events`.

== Service/Application Health Checks

If the deployed services contain a health endpoint, or if they contain an endpoint
that can be used to determine if the service is up, you can use `livenessProbes`
and/or `readinessProbes`.

.Health check endpoints vs. functional endpoints
[NOTE]
====
A proper health check is always preferred if designed correctly.

Despite the fact that any endpoint could potentially be used to infer if your
application is up, it is better to have an endpoint specifically for health in
your application.
Such an endpoint will only respond affirmatively when all your setup code on
the server has finished and the application is running in a desired state.
====

The `livenessProbes` and `readinessProbes` share configuration options and probe types.

initialDelaySeconds::
Number of seconds to wait before performing the very first liveness probe.

periodSeconds::
Number of seconds that the kubelet should wait between liveness probes.

successThreshold::
Number of minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful (Default: 1).

failureThreshold::
Number of times this probe is allowed to fail in order to assume that the service
is not responding (Default: 3).

timeoutSeconds::
Number of seconds after which the probe times out (Default: 1).

There are different options for the `livenessProbes` to check:

Command::
A command executed within a container; a return code of 0 means success.
All other return codes mean failure.

TCP::
If a TCP connection can be established is considered success.

HTTP::
Any HTTP response between `200` and `400` indicates success.

=== livenessProbe

livenessProbes are used to detect running but misbehaving pods/a service that might be running
(the process didn't die), but that is not responding as expected.
You can find out more about livenessProbes here:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/

Probes are executed by each `kubelet` against the pods that define them and that
are running in that specific node. When a `livenessProbe` fails, {kube} will automatically
restart the pod and increase the `RESTARTS` count for that pod. These probes will be
executed every `periodSeconds` starting from `initialDelaySeconds`.

=== readinessProbe

readinessProbes are used to wait for processes that take some time to start.
Find out more about readinessProbes here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-readiness-probes
Despite the container running, it might be performing some time consuming initialization operations.
During this time, you don't want {kube} to route traffic to that specific pod.
You also don't want that container to be restarted because it will appear unresponsive.

These probes will be executed every `periodSeconds` starting from `initialDelaySeconds`
until the service is ready.

Both probe types can be used at the same time. If a service is running, but  misbehaving,
the `livenessProbe` will ensure that it's restarted, and the `readinessProbe`
will ensure that {kube}  won't route traffic to that specific pod until it's considered
to be fully functional and running again.

== General Health Checks

We recommend to apply other best practices from system administration to your
monitoring and health checking approach. These steps are not specific to {productname}
and are beyond the scope of this document.
