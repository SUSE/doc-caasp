= Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

== Introduction

RBAC uses the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` API group to drive authorization decisions, allowing administrators to dynamically configure policies through the {kube} API.

The authentication components are deployed as part of the {productname} installation.
Administrators can update LDAP identity providers before or after platform deployment.
After deploying {productname}, administrators can use {kube} RBAC to design
user or group authorizations.
Users can access with a Web browser or command line to do the authentication and
self-configure `kubectl` to access authorized resources.

== Authentication Flow

Authentication is composed of:

* *Dex* (https://github.com/dexidp/dex) is an identity provider service
(idP) that uses OIDC (Open ID Connect: https://openid.net/connect/)
to drive authentication for client applications.
It acts as a portal to defer authentication to provider through connected
identity providers (connectors).
* *Client*:
  . Web browser: *Gangway* (https://github.com/heptiolabs/gangway):
  a Web application that enables authentication flow for your {productname}.
  The user can login, authorize access, download `kubeconfig` or self-configure `kubectl`.
  . Command line: `skuba auth login`, a CLI application that enables authentication
  flow for your {productname}. The user can log in, authorize access, and get `kubeconfig`.

For RBAC, administrators can use `kubectl` to create corresponding
`RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` for a user or group to limit resource access.

=== Web Flow
image::oidc_flow_web.png[]
// Source: suse-rbac-oidc-flow-web.xml (open with http://draw.io/app)

. User requests access through Gangway.
. Gangway redirects to Dex.
. Dex redirects to connected identity provider (connector).
User login and a request to approve access are generated.
. Dex continues with OIDC authentication flow on behalf of the user
and creates/updates data to {kube} CRDs.
. Dex redirects the user to Gangway.
This redirect includes (ID/refresh) tokens.
. Gangway returns a link to download `kubeconfig` or self-configures `kubectl`
instructions to the user.

. User downloads `kubeconf` or self-configures `kubectl`.
. User uses `kubectl` to connect to the {kube} API server.
. {kube} CRDs validate the {kube} API server request and return a response.
. The `kubectl` connects to the authorized {kube} resources through the {kube} API server.

=== CLI Flow

// Source: suse-rbac-oidc-flow-cli.xml (open with http://draw.io/app)

. User requests access through `skuba auth login` with the Dex server URL,
username and password.
. Dex uses received username and password to log in and approve the access
request to the connected identity providers (connectors).
. Dex continues with the OIDC authentication flow on behalf of the user and
creates/updates data to the {kube} CRDs.
. Dex returns the ID token and refresh token to `skuba auth login`.
. `skuba auth login` generates the kubeconfig file `kubeconf.txt`.
. User uses `kubectl` to connect the {kube} API server.
. {kube} CRDs validate the {kube} API server request and return a response.
. The `kubectl` connects to the authorized {kube} resources through {kube} API server.

== RBAC Operations

=== Administration

==== {kube} Role Binding

Administrators can create {kube} `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` for users.
This grants permission to users on the {kube} cluster like in the example below.

In order to create a `RoleBinding` for `<USER-1>`, `<USER-2>`, and `<GROUP-1>`
using the `ClusterRole` `admin` you would run the following:

----
$ kubectl create rolebinding admin --clusterrole=admin --user=<USER-1> --user=<USER-2> --group=<GROUP-1>
----

==== Update the Authentication Connector

Administrators can update the authentication connector settings after {productname}
deployment as follows:

. Open the `dex` configmap in `<cluster name>/addons/dex/dex.yaml` .
. Adapt ConfigMap by adding LDAP configuration to the connector section of the `config.yaml` data.
For detailed configuration of the LDAP connector, refer to Dex documentation:
https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/v2.16.0/Documentation/connectors/ldap.md.
The following is an *example LDAP connector:*
+
====

  connectors:
  - type: ldap
    id: 389ds
    name: 389ds
    config:
      host: ldap.example.org:636
      rootCAData: <base64 encoded PEM file>
      bindDN: cn=user-admin,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org
      bindPW: <Password of Bind DN>
      usernamePrompt: Email Address
      userSearch:
        baseDN: ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org
        filter: "(objectClass=person)"
        username: mail
        idAttr: DN
        emailAttr: mail
        nameAttr: cn
      groupSearch:
        baseDN: ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=org
        filter: "(objectClass=groupOfNames)"
        userAttr: DN
        groupAttr: member
        nameAttr: cn
====
. A base64 encoded PEM file can be generated by running:
+
----
$ cat <root-ca-pem-file> | base64 | awk '{print}' ORS='' && echo
----
Besides the LDAP connector you can also set up other connectors.
For additional connectors, refer to the available connector configurations in the Dex repository:
https://github.com/dexidp/dex/tree/v2.16.0/Documentation/connectors.
+
. Update Dex deployment:
+
----
kubectl replace --force -f <cluster-name>/addons/dex/dex.yaml
----

=== User Access

==== Setting up `kubectl`

===== In the Web Browser

. Go to the login page at `+https://<CONTROL-PLANE IP/FQDN>:32001+` in your browser.
. Click "Sign In".
. Choose the login method.
. Enter the login credentials.
. Download `kubeconfig` or self-configure `kubectl` with the provided setup instructions.

===== Using the CLI

. Use `skuba auth login` with Dex server URL `+https://<CONTROL-PLANE IP/FQDN>:32000+`,
login username and password.
. The kubeconfig `kubeconf.txt` is generated locally.

==== Access {kube} Resources

The user can now access resources in the authorized `<NAMESPACE>`.

If the user has the proper permissions to access the resources, the output should look like this:

----
# kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> get pod

If the user does not have the right permissions to access a resource,
they will receive a `Forbidden` message.
