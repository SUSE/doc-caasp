== Deployment on existing SLES installation

If you already have a running {sle} 15 SP1 installation, you can add {productname}
to this installation using SUSE Connect. You also need to enable the "Containers"
module because it contains some dependencies required by {productname}.

Retrieve your {productname} registration code and run.
Substitute `CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.

[source,bash]
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.1/x86_64

SUSEConnect -p caasp/4.0/x86_64 -r CAASP_REGISTRATION_CODE
